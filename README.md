# DesmosToSVG

An SVG export button for [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/) using GreaseMonkey

## Installation

Please install the browser extension GreaseMonkey and checkout the
simple way to install the script [on their website](https://wiki.greasespot.net/Greasemonkey_Manual:Installing_Scripts).

## Usage

Navigate to [the main calculator page of Desmos.com](https://www.desmos.com/calculator)
and click on the button "Get SVG" in the top-right side of the page to download an SVG file corresponding
to what the screen is displaying.

Note that the downloaded file will not have the ".svg" extension nor any relevant name,
although its content will be that of an SVG file.

## Final note

This script has only been tested on Mozilla Firefox.
For other browsers the behavior might be different when downloading the SVG picture.

Please report to me the result of using my script using any other browser not listed above.

Thank you for using DesmosToSVG!
